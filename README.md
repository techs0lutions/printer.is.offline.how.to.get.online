Those who frequently use their printers have likely encountered an instance where a machine is on and ready to print, but the attached computer thinks it is offline. In most cases this is a simple communication error that is occurring at some point between the computer and printer. Normally this will be the result of a previous error or a cable having come loose, but “Offline” printers can however be caused by issues with a printer driver or even the manufacturers software.

## How can you make my offline printer show as online again?

* Physical Checks
* Set the Printer to “Online” Manually
* Remove All Pending Print Jobs
* Removing and Reinstalling Your Printer
* Removing Drivers and Packages

## How to set the Printer to “Online” Manually

* Go to the Start icon on the bottom left of your screen then choose Control Panel and then Devices and Printers.
* Right click the printer in question and select “See what’s printing”.
* From the window that opens choose “Printer” from the menu bar at the top.
* Select “Use Printer Online” from the drop down menu.
